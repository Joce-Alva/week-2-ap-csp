# Day 2 Review Activity: My Personal Info Generator
# ----------------------------------------

print(" Welcome to the Python Review Activity!")
print("You’ll review variables, strings, numbers, and print formatting.\n")

# Step 1: Create Variables
# TODO: Replace the values below with your own info
first_name = "Jocelyn"
age = 16
favorite_color = "Green"
favorite_number = 31

#  Step 2: Practice String Operations
# 1. Print your name in uppercase
print(first_name.upper())

# 2. Print how many letters are in your name
print(len(first_name))

# 3. Combine your name and favorite color into one message
print("My name is " + first_name + " and my favorite color is " +favorite_color)

#  Step 3: Math Practice
# Use arithmetic operators with your favorite number
x=12
favorite_number=31
print(f"Addition: {x+favorite_number}")
#  Step 4: User Input Practice
# Ask the user two questions and combine answers
name1=input ("What is your name?")
age1=input ("How old are you?")
print('Your name is ' + name1 + " and you are " + age1 + "years old")



# ⚙️ Step 5: Final Challenge (combine it all)
# Use math and strings together

add_result = 30 + 10
print('Addition (30 + 10):', add_result)
